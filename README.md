ðŸ’¼ Profit Analysis Assessment
Project Overview:
This project analyzes the profitability of a business using historical financial data. It provides insights into revenue, costs, profit margins, and other financial KPIs, helping stakeholders understand the key drivers of profitability and where improvements can be made.

Features:
Revenue vs. Cost Analysis: Visual breakdown of revenues, fixed costs, and variable costs.
Profitability Metrics: Calculation and visualization of gross profit, net profit, and profit margins.
Product/Segment-Level Analysis: Identify the most profitable products or business segments.
Trend Analysis: Track revenue, costs, and profit over time to uncover trends and seasonality.
Scenario Forecasting: "What-if" analysis to simulate changes in costs or pricing and their impact on profitability.
Tech Stack:
Data Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data manipulation and visualization.
Dashboard: Jupyter Notebook or Streamlit for interactive data exploration.
Data Source: CSV/Excel financial data or SQL database with historical revenue and cost records.
Cloud & Hosting: Deployed on Google Colab, Streamlit Cloud, or local Jupyter Notebook.
Installation Instructions:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Riteshab/profit-analysis-assessment.git

Navigate to the project folder:
cd profit-analysis-assessment

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Jupyter Notebook or Streamlit app:
jupyter notebook

or

streamlit run app.py

Usage:
Upload your financial data (CSV/Excel) into the project.
Run the notebook or dashboard to explore revenue, cost, and profit trends.
Use the product/segment analysis to dive deeper into specific business areas.
Adjust variables in the scenario forecasting tool to simulate different business conditions and analyze their effect on profitability.
Project Files:
data/: Folder for input financial data (e.g., revenue, cost, product data).
notebooks/: Contains the Jupyter notebooks for profit analysis and visualization.
app.py: Streamlit app file for interactive profit analysis.
requirements.txt: List of dependencies (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Streamlit, etc.).
Profit Metrics Explained:
Gross Profit:

GrossProfit=Revenueâˆ’CostofGoodsSold(COGS)
Net Profit:
NetProfit=Revenueâˆ’TotalExpenses(COGS+OperatingExpenses)
Profit Margin:
ProfitMargin=(NetProfit/Revenue)Ã—100

Future Enhancements:
Add real-time data integration via APIs (e.g., financial data feeds).
Create automated reports for monthly or quarterly profitability.
Integrate more advanced forecasting models using machine learning.
